	<p> This is a web-application for calculating the Halo Mass Function. It is written by Steven Murray <a href="hmf_acknowledgments/">with others</a> at the 
	International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research (ICRAR). </p>
	 
	<p>If you would like to acknowledge use of this application, please cite <a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.6721>this article</a>. </p>
	
	<p>Please check out other information about the mass function and this calculator by following the links at the top of this page. </p>
	
	<p>Note that this calculator is a work in progress. We are confident it does what it advertises well and robustly, but there is 
	always room for improvement. Please <a href='/contact_info'>contact us directly</a> or let us know via the Twitter panel on the right if you find any bugs, have ideas for new features, or notice any design flaws!
	If you notice something after producing a plot, don't hesitate to click the "Contact Us!" link at the top of the page -- your data will be persistent!</p>

	<p>Finally, the calculation backend for this web-app is written in Python and is made open-source via <a href="www.github.com/steven-murray/hmf">github</a>.
	If you have a working python installation you can install it simply with "pip install hmf".</p>
