This page contains several downloads and links to resources about the HMF. Whether it is downloadable code,
articles or summary tables, you'll find it here. 
</p>

<h3>Getting the code</h3>
You can use the functionality of HMF<em>calc</em> offline with greater flexibility by using the backend package, hmf, directly. It is a python
package, and relies on several other libraries, including numpy, scipy and pycamb. To get it for yourself, simply use pip:
<pre>
$ pip install hmf
</pre>
If you have any trouble installing, please let us know or head to the <a href="http://www.github.com/steven-murray/hmf">github repository</a> where the
entire code is made open source. While you're there, raise any issues you have with the code, and feel free to grab it and start contributing!

The <a href="http://www.github.com/steven-murray/HMFcalc">code for HMF<em>calc</em></a> is also made available on github, so go and check it out and fix
any bugs you find!

<h3>Code Using hmf</h3>
<p>
Here are some code snippets which use hmf to do a variety of things. Grab them for inspiration or education.
If you have code of your own that you would like to share, get in contact with us and we'll add it!
