0.9.75- 18 March 2013
		Urgent bugfix
		dlnsdlnM called too early.
		CAMB-made transfer function file deleted too early.
		
0.9.7 - 18 March 2013
		Modified set_z() so it only does calculations necessary when z changes
        Made calculation of dlnsdlnM in init since it is same for all z
        Removed mean density redshift dependence
        Put version number on page headers
        Output version number in ascii files
        
0.9.6 - 12 March 2013
		Updated ngtm/Mgtm to be their own methods
		Added nltm/Mltm to Perturbations()
		Added these as options to the form.py
		Now makes use of pandas instead of those accursed numpy recarrays
		This makes adding new methods and functions extremely simple.
		Added version number to base template and settings.py
		Added a "start again" link to plots page
		Made the extra plots (N>M etc) have their own form section.
		Updated PlotChoices() in forms.py so all extra plots can be viewed when appropriate
		
0.9.5 - 11 March 2013
        First version number. 
		The site works, and has had a bit of work up to this point.
		HMF is calculated correctly.
		Also other functions akin to the HMF.
